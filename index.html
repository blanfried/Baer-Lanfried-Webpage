<div class="aboutMeText">
      <p> I am a new developer finding my way in this new virtual world. I am quickly realizing that I enjoy backend development the most. </p>

      <p> I am from California originally, but I have spent the past six years abroad. During the first five years I was in France, and this past year I have been living in the UK. </p>

      <p> I enjoy reading, hiking, bodysurfing, reading a good book, watching a good movie, speaking different languages, and spending time with friends and family. </p>
      
      <p> I have a BA in both Psychology and Philosophy and I am currently finishing my MA in Philosophy of Religion and Ethics.</p>
